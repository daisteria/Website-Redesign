                <p>Please note that the number four is unviewable in this font family. 
                    They appear like 4 in some sections. Other unsupported characters
                    that I found was substituted to the best of my ability, with the 
                    exception of 
                    the forward slash and hashtag, 
                    which I could not substitute. I was unable to debug these issues
                    with the downloaded CC open licensed font, so I ask for your 
                    consideration in overlooking this issue. The overall site is 
                    still legible, but might be confusing when the unsupported 
                    character is displayed.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car#">

                <p>The original information architecture derived from Wikipedia’s 
                    car page contained a total of 21 subsections, most of which 
                    did not contain any child subsections. Some of these 
                    categories could be compiled into a single directory since 
                    their information is similar. For instance, the ‘User 
                    Interface’ and ‘Electronics and Interior’ sections both 
                    contain information that could fall under a single ‘Car 
                    interior’ category, and the ‘Environmental Issues’ and 
                    ‘Social Issues’ both denote issues about cars. Some 
                    categories, like the subsections under ‘Emerging Car 
                    Technologies’, contained information that was already 
                    repeated in the long ‘History’ section, and so these 
                    subdirectories were removed in the revised information 
                    architecture for redundancy. </p>

                    <h6>Revised Information Architecture.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>Upon analyzing the original subsections, all categories could be 
                    reorganized into relevant and broad topics. As such, the 
                    global structural navigation headers now consist of topics that 
                    contain information about cars, the history, the specifications,
                    considerations, and further external information. This pertains
                    to Brown’s principle of front doors, which assumes that at 
                    least half of the website’s visitors will come to the site 
                    through some other subpage. Having a list of global structural
                    navigation headers that encompass all the content in the 
                    website at the top of the pages for global access will allow 
                    such users to navigate through the site more efficiently. 
                    The organization of these new headers also follow the 
                    principle of focused navigation, where a site’s most crucial 
                    topic navigation features separate and distinct information.</p>
                <p>To add, the categories have been labelled in accordance to its 
                    navigation status for implementation. The global structural 
                    headers are to be added at the top as aforementioned, and the 
                    utility is to be implemented in the footer of the website. The 
                    subsections of these categories are found in their respective 
                    pages, which were moved to categories that their content best 
                    fit. This follows Brown’s principle of objects, which is the 
                    organization of similar content, as it takes similar sections 
                    from the original information architecture and compiles it in a 
                    single topic in the revised version.</p>
                <p>This revised information architecture in general satisfies Brown’s
                    principle of growth, which is the assumption that a website’s 
                    current content is just a fraction of the content that it will 
                    have in the future. In other words, a site should organize their 
                    content in such a way that it will be easier to add information 
                    after initial implementation. The revised global navigation 
                    categories are designed to be broad enough to encompass all 
                    information about cars. This also ensures that any future added 
                    content can likely fall under one of the main global topics. If 
                    this is not the case, then a new global directory can be added 
                    easily.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>The following sketches and calculations are my personal 
                    documentation based on the University of Winnipeg’s
                    website on the left. The images and XD files are not 
                    necessarily wireframes, but rather a general outline of the 
                    sections found on the university website’s landing page and a 
                    few pages that I chose to use to model my replicate website on. 
                    They represent the estimated width, height, and container layout
                    of each page.</p>
                <p>The wireframe does not have any significant revisions, since it 
                    is intended to replicate the accompanying university website. 
                    In addition, the following pages are wireframed: the Uwinnipeg 
                    landing page and two inner pages. These two inner pages are to 
                    be the process page and the required inner page as per the 
                    project criteria.</p>
                <p>The wireframe XD file can be found in “a1/docs/website_wireframes.xd”,

                <p>Modelled after: <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/">UWinnipeg Home</a></p>
                <p>These photos show screenshots of the wireframes used to estimate
                    the general layout of the landing page. A few conclusions that I
                    came across is that each section contains two main containers: the
                    container that spans the width of the whole page, and the smaller
                    container that sits in the middle of the first container and holds
                    all the contents of that section. Secondly, the news and events
                    section are roughly the same, and so this is to be accounted for
                    when coding this page.</p>
                <h5>Inner Page</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/wf-inner-1.png">
                    <h6>Directory, left links list and events, and right content

                <p>I noticed that the contents consist of two columns: a left column
                    that consists of the page traversal list, and a right column that
                    contains the heading, images, and content. The directory path
                    section in between the body content and the global navigation 
                    header also appears to follow this consistency, putting the
                    website path in the right column while leaving the left column
                    blank.</p>
                <h5>Inner Process Page</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/wf-process.png">

                <p>This inner page is roughly the same as the template inner page, 
                    with the exclusion of the events list in the left column and the
                    highlights in the right.

                <h5>Video</h5>
                <p>Around the same time, I began to look for potential car videos
                    that encapsulate the same emotions and visual aesthetics as 
                    the UWinnipeg spotlight video. I created a car video playlist 
                    of potential spotlight videos that can be found 
                    <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztbSlOy7DzaEh2n-xR9p6jDy1ICgqd1t&si=yOzz0fPvJMPJfKD_ " target="_blank">here on Youtube</a>.</p>
                <p>All videos in the playlist are creative common source licensed. 
                    A video that showed this aesthetic that I was hoping to achieve
                    was used as the placeholder when building the site, but it is
                    not open licensed. However, it can be found
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/eNFKHh_MUXY?si=5QtidbUU4JgJdR_q" target="_blank">here</a>,
                    for reference.</p>

            <div class="big-right-container-text-section" id="prototype">
                <h2>Prototype and Building</h2>
                <p>Following the sketches and wireframe estimations, the 
                    final prototype was created.</p>
                <p>Upon inspecting the UWinnipeg website, I found that 
                    the font family used was a free licensed Adobe font 
                    called ‘proxima–nova’. As such, I have downloaded and 
                    imported this font into the fonts folder at “/a1/fonts/Demo_Fonts/”.
                    In addition, all webpage titles follow the general format of
                    “current–page, ../, ../ ...”, and so this is reflected in
                    each page’s title.</p>
                <p>Overall, the pages are a 1:1 replica to the original website, 
                    with the differences primarily shown in content and perhaps a 
                    few pixels off of the original layout due to human error and 
                    eye estimation （I used a physical ruler on my
                    screen and sometimes my fingernail while alt tabbing between
                    the UWinnipeg and my own site）.</p>
                <p>Note that most of the links found on the landing page are fully 
                    functional; i.e. the ‘Featured News’ and ‘Upcoming Car Events’ 
                    links all lead to their respective references, and all 
                    references to these are found in the Media section below for 
                    added clarity. In the header, the ‘Wiki’ link directs to the 
                    Car Wikipedia page. In the global navigation under, the logo
                    leads to the home page like the UWinnipeg site, and the ‘Exterior’,
                    ‘Lighting’, ‘Weight’, and ‘Body Style’ links all direct to the
                    Exterior inner page as per the Project Criteria. The ‘Process’
                    tab leads to this page. In the footer, the ‘Exteriors’ link 
                    under Information leads to the Exterior page. The ‘Original Website’
                    in the section after this footer navigation leads to the Wiki page.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Header</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-header-landing.png">
                    <h6>Finished header with borders for visualization.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>Creating the header was simple: creating a container that spans
                    the width of the whole screen, and then aligning a child container
                    inside that will contain the links and search icon. The links on
                    the left are justified to the start, and the right links and search
                    are justified to the end. I also added the animation that a faint
                    underline appears when each link is hovered over.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Global Header Navigation</h5>

                </div>
                <p>This section sits on top of the spotlight, so the position must be
                    absolute and it must have a z index higher than the spotlight for
                    stacking layers. Like the header, it contains a left and right
                    container in the child container of the parent nav section. At its
                    current state, the section background is transparent with a border
                    at the bottom.</p>
                <p>Note that at this point, the revised IA category ‘System Interface’
                    is revised to ‘Specifications’ for simplicity and shortening. It
                    still categorizes the original revised subdirectories.

                    the animation of the bottom border expanding from the middle when a link
                    is hovered over is replicated on the site. In addition, the overlay container
                    follows the absolute positioning of the nav section over the 
                    spotlight section. The overlay consists of four columns, all with 
                    max widths as estimated guesses.</p>
                <p>The button in the first column of the overlay also has an animation
                    courtesy of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20751998">this</a>.
                    The links in the other columns also have animations according to the
                    UWinnipeg website. Namely, upon hover, the second and third column
                    links translate to the right and turn red, and the related links
                    column links turn red only.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Spotlight</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-spotlight.png">
                    <h6>Finished spotlight.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>The spotlight contains a background video, which was edited; the
                    process can be found in the Media section. The h2 title and subtext
                    have a slight textshadow to avoid bad contrasting against the video,
                    maintaining the WCAG guidelines. The play and pause button follows
                    the original website, which I found to be slightly harder about
                    building this website, since it required a bit of research and
                    recollection of my Java knowledge. Ultimately, the script and
                    reference can be found before the end tag of the body section.
                    In addition, the chevron arrow pointing down scrolls the viewport to
                    the intro, or next, section.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Intro</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-intro.png">
                    <h6>Finished intro.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>The intro is simple: it sets the h4, h2, and p styles for other
                    sections respectively. It is aligned to the very center of the
                    container.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Card</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-card.png">
                    <h6>Finished card.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>This card introduces the class for images that are cropped for
                    a specific width and height dimension. It also introduces the
                    class that contains an icon and a link in one container. It uses
                    the h4, h2, and p styles that were set in the previous section.
                    To add, the card has a box shadow to replicate the other website.
                    The image of the car, a Mazda Miata, is referenced in the Media
                    section. All other photos used in later sections are also
                    referenced in the aforementioned Media section.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Table of Links</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-two-links-cols.png">
                    <h6>Finished table of links.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>The following simply replicates a table of previously set classes:
                    the inline icon and text, and h2. It also has an animation that
                    translates the right arrow to the right when the link container is
                    hovered over and turns the h2 text red.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Numbers</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-numbers.png">
                    <h6>Finished number statistics. The dollar sign was unsupported, and
                        so this final product uses a different version of the dollar sign.
                    </h6>
                </div>
                <p>The statistics found in the three containers are from the 
                    Statistics Canada page 
                    <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010002402">here</a>,
                    <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010005604">here</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2310030801">here</a>
                    respectively. I was unable to figure out how to replicate the animation of
                    the numbers increasing when the container was viewed, but an estimated
                    guess based on previous coding knowledge suggests that it likely has
                    to do with using keyframes in CSS manually, or using JavaScript to set 
                    a range for the numbers to animate from and to.
                </p>
                <h5>Landing Page: News</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-news.png">
                    <h6>Finished News section. All links point to referenced news
                        titles. Images are referenced in Media section.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>This section introduces containers for news. Specifically, a 
                    container that has a fixed image dimension and news details.
                    The section overall has a flexbox display, and the news cards
                    contains two columns: one for the big left news card, and one
                    for the four smaller news cards. It uses the preset h4, h2, p,
                    and hover animations.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Events</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-events.png">
                    <h6>Finished Events section.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>The events section contains three columns in the child container,
                    and each column is an inline flex container justified at the top.
                    Each column contains a red square that contains the date that
                    mimics the UWinnipeg site to the best of my ability, given that
                    the font sometimes does not support heavily bolded text nor the
                    number four. It also makes use of the ‘More news’ button class.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Footer Navigation</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-footer-nav.png">
                    <h6>Finished Footer first section part.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>This section contains two blocks: one with four columns, and the
                    other with a simple text. The columns are fit and padded to best
                    mimic the original website footer, and also have the same animations
                    such as the social links, the Donate button, and hovering over the
                    utility. Only the ‘Exterior’ link directs to another page.</p> 
                <p>At this point, the revised IA labels no longer truly
                    apply; for instance, the Interior and Exterior associative categories
                    of the Global Structural ‘Specifications’ are now in Utility too.
                    However, since it was initially assigned as associative labels at
                    the start of the website, i.e. in the global navigation bar overlay,
                    these labels still maintain since the site’s visitors will see these
                    associative links first before they see it in the footer. To add,
                    these associative links were added alongside the utility labels
                    merely for design demonstration purposes, or to fill up the footer
                    with content.</p>
                <h5>Landing Page: Bottom Footer</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-end-footer.png">
                    <h6>Finished Footer bottom section.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>This follows the header layout, except without the use of the 
                    right container. The links are not functional, but still show
                    the animation that is used in the UWinnipeg site. 
                </p>
                <h5>Inner Page: Exterior</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-inner-general.png">
                    <h6>Finished and reevaluated inner page. Chose Exterior as 
                        the content to show depth and actual text content rather
                        than a page with just associative links.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>At this point, I reevaluated the website page that this would
                    replicate, which was originally the Research webpage. 
                    There were many unnecessary items that weren't suitable
                    for the content, i.e. an events section on the left, and highlights
                    at the bottom. So, instead, I chose
                    <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/research/grants/external-research-grants.html">this</a>
                    page instead. It still contains the same layout, meaning that the
                    wireframes are still applicable to the inner page, but this new
                    page no longer keeps the events and highlights section. This way,
                    the content is better suited to fill the page while maintaining
                    the design.</p>
                <p>As explained in the Wireframes section, inner pages typically
                    use two columns. This is demonstrated in the image, where the
                    contents are divided by a left column and a bigger sized right
                    column. What was not mentioned in the Wireframes section, and
                    something that I realized upon starting to build the inner page,
                    is that the child containers of every section is smaller in
                    width than the home page. In CSS, the .container width does
                    not apply to the inner pages. To fix this, I set the header,
                    nav, and footer section to adjust to a new .others-container,
                    which sets the appropriate width that replicates the UWinnipeg
                    site.</p>
                <p>Another format not accounted for in the Wireframes section is 
                    that the navigation section is a permanent white background,
                    and has a box shadow. Since this navigation style is applied
                    globally to all pages, I decided to give the nav tag in
                    inner pages a class. This class, .nav-others, is formatted
                    to override the existing nav presets and set the background
                    colour to white, set a box shadow akin to the UWinnipeg site,
                    and keep the logo on its black version.</p>
                <h5>Inner Page: Collapsibles</h5>
                <div class="others-main-image-caption">
                    <img src="/images/process-images/pt-inner-collapsible.png">
                    <h6>Collapsible sections of the inner page. When a section 
                        is clicked, it opens a block of subtext.</h6>
                </div>
                <p>This general code to create the collapsibles was given by 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp">w3schools</a>,
                    and referenced in the CSS file. The links found in each
                    opened collapsible links to their respective Wiki section.</p>
                <h5>Process Page</h5>
                <p>Creating this process page follows the initial wireframe
                    and site. Since it is similar to the modelled inner page,
                    this process page is modelled after both
                    <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/research/grants/external-research-grants.html">this</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/campus-life/index.html">this</a>.
                    The directory links in the left column all scroll to their
                    respective sections.
                    In addition, this page features a slideshow that was
                    initially supposed to be implemented for the inner page.
                    I found the buttons on the UWinnipeg site slideshow to be
                    difficult to click, and so the dots are found underneath
                    the captions, and extra previous and next buttons are 
                    added for clarity.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="big-right-container-text-section" id="media-refs">

                <h5>Logo</h5>
                <p>Logo by Shmector.com at 
                    <a href="https://shmector.com/free-vector/logo/car_logo/13-0-1504" target="_blank">shmector.com</a>.
                    The original files included can be found in 
                    “a1/docs/logo”. Edited in Adobe Illustrator to fit 
                    the prototype and can be found at “/a1/docs/logo/
                    car–logo–edited.ai”. The white version is a copy
                    of this edit, with ‘style: “fill:white;”’ at the
                    end of the path.</p>
                <p>From the visual studies, it was evident that the 
                    logo would be a front-facing car with no text and
                    perhaps only half of the minimal car silhouette.
                    This logo satisfies that criteria, and so this was
                    chosen.
                </p>
                <h5>Video</h5>
                <p>As mentioned in Visual Studies, the car playlist 
                    was a collection of car cinematics that I felt
                    encapsulated the aesthetic of displaying a car's
                    sleek and smooth manufacturing and finish. I was
                    heavily leaning towards
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/9aF_3AbbkUI?si=djVxqKaeGOMw9-j_">this video</a>,
                    because I wanted a video that showed multiple
                    car types rather than just one, since this site
                    is based on the automobile concept and not a
                    specific vehicle brand type. After hours, I find
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/H70SJvqhR3A?si=g8rjiMSpiE6wV5Bv">this video</a>.
                    This shows eight different car types, and satisfies
                    my search for a cinematic type of showcasing these
                    automobiles.
                </p>
                <p>However, there are many shots that do not feature
                    a car; i.e. the helicopter showcase shots. Thus, I
                    edited the video on Adobe Premiere Pro 2023 to 
                    splice those shots out. Upon adding it to my home
                    page site, I realize that the video is somewhat too
                    bright. This affects WCAG, since the contrast between
                    the spotlight and nav text will be too low for
                    accessibility standards. So, I re–edited the video
                    and added a black rectangle over the whole clip at
                    75 percent opacity. This way, the spotlight is dim,
                    passing WCAG contrasting standards, and primarily
                    giving focus to the text that overlays.
                </p>
